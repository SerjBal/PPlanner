## Introduction
This Unity project showcases the implementation of OOP design patterns, code readability and the Unity engine's features like UI, addressables, and also working with a files, dirictories, strings and async methods in the Unity context without any external assets.

### Patterns
Here i used a state machine pattern for loading and DI services registration. As a DI container i choose a singleton with a some T-services implementation.
And UI working through some kind of MVVM pattern with a commands integration, the view is a monobehaviour with a bindings, the view model is a logic.
Also i used an adapter pattern for some commands and a factory for creating and instantiating UI objects.
